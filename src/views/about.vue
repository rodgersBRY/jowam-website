            Kenyan coffee is cultivated in well-drained red volcanic soils, rich in phosphates, 
            found around the slopes and foothills of Mount Kenya, the Aberdare Ranges, Mount Elgon, 
            the Kisii Highlands, and parts of the Rift Valley. The primary type of coffee grown
            in Kenya is Arabica, with Robusta making up only 1 percent of the production. 
            All Kenyan Arabica is grown at altitudes above 1,220 meters above sea level.
            Kenyan coffee undergoes a meticulous process from seed to cup, including stages 
            such as nursery, farming, pulping, milling, and grading. The coffee is handpicked, 
            hand-sorted, sun-dried, and carefully processed, ensuring that the resulting cup 
            is exceptionally well-balanced in body and acidity, 
            with an intense flavor and a pleasant aroma featuring notes of blackcurrant, honey, 
            caramel, and chocolate. This attention to detail ensures that consumers enjoy only 
            the finest Kenyan coffee, which is among the most sought-after in the world.
            Kenya experiences two distinct flowering seasons each year: March/April and October to December. 
            In most counties, the main crop ripens between October and December, while the early crop is harvested 
            from May to July, ensuring that Kenyan coffee is available year-round.
